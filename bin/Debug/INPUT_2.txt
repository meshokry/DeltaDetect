Each student is required to write a computer program that computes the quality factor of a 
specific rectangular cavity resonator at its first 2 resonances. The program takes the 
conductivity of the waveguide metal, relative permittivity and loss tangent of filling material
and the waveguide dimensions and gives out the resonance frequency, resonance bandwidth
and the quality factor of resonator at the first 2 resonances.
You are required to submit a PDF document containing:
1. Your code (I should be able to copy paste it for verification) + version of software used.
2. The analytical calculations used to compute the values of resonance frequencies, 
resonance bandwidths and quality factors for the first 2 resonance modes for a specific 
set of assumed dimensions (N.B.: code should work for any set of values a,b,d but 
analysis is for one set of dimensions chosen by student). Any necessary clarification on 
your code should be written. 
It is important that the report is the result of the student’s individual work and meets the 
faculty’s expectations of originality.
